# Computational Physics Fundamentals

This repository contains fundamental codes, notebooks, and visualizations developed as part of a computational physics course. It focuses on building a strong foundation for solving basic physical problems using Python programming and numerical methods.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** – Interactive notebooks for step-by-step explanations, symbolic computation, and visualizations.
- **Python Scripts (`.py`)** – Modular scripts for reusable functions and simulations.

## Topics Covered

The materials span a range of introductory and essential topics in computational physics:

### Symbolic and Analytical Calculations (using `SymPy`)
- Calculus (differentiation, integration)
- Implicit equations and differential systems
- Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics

### Data Visualization (using `Matplotlib`)
- 2D and 3D plots
- Quantum systems: particle in a box, quantum harmonic oscillator
- Radiation curves: blackbody radiation visualization

### Numerical and Statistical Tools
- Regression and curve fitting
- Numerical derivatives and integrals
- Arithmetic and trigonometric operations

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `matplotlib`

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib
